                                <p>Association of Computer Engineering Students (ACES) is the student body of the Computer Engineering undergraduates of Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya. Every year ACES organizes various events & activities with the aid of highly qualified academic staff members to enlighten the knowledge of the undergraduates and to serve the society. ACES Coders V5.0 is one of the events that is organized annually to prepare undergraduates for IEEEXtreme global programming competition.</p>
                                <p>ACES Coders started five years ago as a practice event to train Computer Engineering students at Peradeniya to take part in similar online programming competitions such as IEEEXtreme and ACM ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest).</p>
                                <p>In a short period, it has gained popularity and has become the most popular coding competition among undergraduates in Sri Lanka. Students from all the universities take part in a twelve hours coding competition that gives multiple problems to solve by using the knowledge of programming. It was a limited time, rapid coding competition that would improve the efficiency and accuracy of the participants. Since this year, an additional part is added to this programme targeting school Advanced Level students of Mathematical and IT streams to give knowledge about hardware and software to the school community.</p>
